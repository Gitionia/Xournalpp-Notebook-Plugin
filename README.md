# Xournalpp-Notebook-Plugin
## Description
This is a simple implementation of notebooks in Xournal++, similar to onenote, as a plugin. It uses folders in a certain root directory to represent a notebook that contains files. There are also UI-Buttons for switching between notebooks or files. This repository consists mainly of one lua script that can also be adapted to the users needs.

## Installation
Download the folder containing the .lua and .ini file and copy it into the plugin folder (depends on platform, see also https://xournalpp.github.io/guide/file-locations/) of Xournal++.
Then open the .lua file and set a root directory where the notebooks should be stored.

## Usage
You can add 5 custom UI-Buttons that you can add by customizing the toolbar. Four of them allow for switching to the next or previous notebook or file and the one allows to select any notebook and then choose a file.
