# Xournalpp-Notebook-Plugin
This is a simple implementation of notebooks in Xournal++, similar to onenote, as a plugin. It uses folders in a certain root directory to represent a notebook that contain files. There are also UI-Buttons for switching between notebooks or files. This repository consists mainly of one lua script that can also be adapted to the users needs.
